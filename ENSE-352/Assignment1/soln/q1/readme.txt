Question: Why does this directory have no q1.h file?

Answer: this directory initially contains no header file "q1.h"
because that is *your* job to create this file in such a way that
it solves the problem of Q1.

The other directories (q2 and q3) *do* have header files q2.h and
q3.h.  You don't have to write those because they contain the
interface specification, and your job is to write the q2.cpp and
q3.cpp files which implement that specification.
